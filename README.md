Website About Me
================

Quick Description
------------------
A lot of the time I hear people complain about how they cannot fit enough info about them on a resume. This website serves to show my career aspirations as well as jobs I've taken on in the past.

Created using React.js and JSX, with HTML/Bootstrap v4

Installation Instructions
-------------------------
To run this project, follow these steps:
	clone the repo using ``git clone``
	navigate to the folder ``my-portfolio-app``
	run ``npm install`` to install node_modules
	run ``npm start`` to start the service on ``localhost:3000``

At first I thought of just using a template for a portfolio website since it would be much easier and take less time. Seeing [this](https://colorlib.com/preview/#jackson) template made me realize how convoluted the html code was, and how the perfect opportunity for a project would be to re-create this template under React.js and add some elegance/neatness to the code with JSX.
