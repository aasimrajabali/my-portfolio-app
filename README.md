Website About Me
================

Quick Description
------------------
A lot of the time I hear people complain about how they cannot fit enough info about them on a resume. When it comes down to it I'm absolutely one of those people, so this website serves to show my career aspirations as well as jobs I've taken on in the past. I also plan on adding more to this project then a typical resume would have, such as blogs, past work, etc.

Created using React.js and JSX, with HTML/Bootstrap v4

Installation Instructions
-------------------------
1. clone the repo using ``git clone``
2. navigate to the folder ``my-portfolio-app``
3. run ``npm install`` to install node_modules
4. run ``npm start`` to start the service on ``localhost:3000``

Credit

At first I thought of just using a template for a portfolio website since it would be much easier and take less time. Seeing [this](https://colorlib.com/preview/#jackson) template made me realize that although the site looks amazing, the html code was incredibly convoluted. From there I saw the perfect opportunity for a project: to re-create this template under React.js and add some elegance/neatness to the code with JSX.

Coming Soon
